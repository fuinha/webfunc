# WebFunc - The Mini Web Server For Google Cloud Functions
## Intro
Add easy CORS support with a _**webconfig.json**_ file and simplify creation & deployment of Google Cloud Functions projects.

## Install
```
npm install webfunc -g
```
## How To Use It
```
webfunc init
```
This will ask some basic questions and will initialize a HelloWorld Web App ready to be hosted on Google Cloud.

To deploy it locally (using @google-cloud/functions-emulator)
```
webfunc deploy
```

To deploy it to a Google Cloud Account (that you must have presumably configured during the ```webfunc init``` step)
```
webfunc deploy build
```

## Configuring Your Mini Web Server - webconfig.json
#### CORS
This is the main 'raison d'Ãªtre' of this project. Out-of-the box, Google Cloud Functions does not support easy configuration for CORS when triggered through HTTP (at least as of July 2017). Webfunc provides an easy to configure CORS through its _**webconfig.json**_ file. 

```js
{
  "headers": {
    "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, POST",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type, Origin",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": "true",
    "Access-Control-Max-Age": "1296000"
  }
}
```

#### Adding Multiple Deployment Environments
Let's imagine that 3 different environments have been setup on a Google Cloud Account, the webfunc can easily deploy to any of those environment if they have been configured in the project's _**webconfig.json**_ file:

```js
{
  "env": {
    "default": {
      "functionName": "helloneap",
      "trigger": "--trigger-http",
      "entryPoint": "helloNeap",
      "googleProject": "DevEnv",
      "bucket": "devenvbucket"
    },
    "build": {
      "functionName": "helloneap",
      "trigger": "--trigger-http",
      "entryPoint": "helloNeap",
      "googleProject": "DevEnv",
      "bucket": "devenvbucket"
    },
    "staging": {
      "functionName": "helloneap",
      "trigger": "--trigger-http",
      "entryPoint": "helloNeap",
      "googleProject": "StagingEnv",
      "bucket": "stagingenvbucket"
    },
    "prod": {
      "functionName": "helloneap",
      "trigger": "--trigger-http",
      "entryPoint": "helloNeap",
      "googleProject": "ProdEnv",
      "bucket": "prodenvbucket"
    }
  }
}
```

To deploy to a specific environment(prod for example):
```
webfunc deploy prod
```
